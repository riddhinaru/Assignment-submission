Day 1 Assignment
Topic: Mention the difference between Compiler and Interpreter.
Compiler:-
It scans the entire program in one go.
As and when scanning is performed, all these are shown in the end together, not line by line.
It converts the source code to object code.
Its execution time is less, hence it is preferred.
It doesn’t require the source code for execution later.
Programming languages that uses compilers are C, C++, C#.
It helps parse or analyse the language statements.
It takes an entire program as input and generates intermediate machine code as output.
Difficult to implement as compilers cannot predict what happens at turn time.

And

Interpreter:-
The program is interpreted/translated one line at a time.
One line of code is scanned, and errors encountered are shown.
Usually, interpreter is slow, and hence takes more time to execute the object code.
It is not preferred due to its slow speed.
It doesn’t convert source code into object code.
It requires the source code for execution later.
Programming languages that uses interpreter are- Python, Ruby, Perl, MATLAB.
